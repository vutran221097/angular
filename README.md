# Angular Overview

# What is Angular?

- Angular is open-source front-end web framework developed by Google.
- It's designed to build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

# Key Features

## 1. Structured Framework:

Angular provides a well-defined structure that helps in organizing code efficiently. Its modular approach with components, services, and modules makes code more maintainable and scalable.

## 2. Powerful Templating and Data Binding:

Angular’s two-way data binding simplifies the synchronization between the model and the view, reducing the need for manual DOM manipulation.

## 3. Dependency Injection:

Built-in dependency injection simplifies component management, making the codebase more modular, reusable, and testable.

## 4. TypeScript:

Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds strong typing, improved tooling, and better error detection to JavaScript development.

## 5. Rich Ecosystem and Community Support:

Angular has a vast ecosystem with tools like Angular CLI for project scaffolding, Angular Material for UI components, and NgRx for state management. The community actively contributes libraries, extensions, and resources.

## 6. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture:

Angular follows the MVVM architecture, making it easier to separate concerns, manage application logic, and enhance testability.

## 7. Cross-Platform Development:

With Angular, developers can use the same codebase to build applications for the web, mobile (using frameworks like NativeScript or Ionic), and desktop (using Electron).

## 8. Comprehensive Tooling:

Angular offers a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for testing, debugging, and performance optimization, aiding in faster development cycles.

## 9. Robust Routing and Navigation:

Angular’s router provides powerful features for handling navigation and routing between different views or pages within an application.

## 10. Backed by Google:

Angular is maintained and backed by Google, which ensures continuous updates, improvements, and long-term support.

# Getting Started

To begin with Angular, you need to install Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Then, follow these steps:

- Create a new Angular project: `ng new --no-standalone project-name`
- Run the development server: `ng serve`
