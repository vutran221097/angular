# Angular Overview

# What is Angular?

- Angular is open-source front-end web framework developed by Google.
- It's designed to build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

# Key Features

- TypeScript
  Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, which brings strong typing and other advanced features to JavaScript development.

- Component-Based Architecture
  It follows a component-based architecture where the application is divided into reusable and manageable components.

- Two-Way Data Binding
  Angular offers powerful data binding capabilities, including both one-way and two-way data binding, simplifying the synchronization between the model and the view.

- Directives
  Directives like ngIf, ngFor, and ngStyle allow developers to manipulate the DOM, control rendering, and add behavior to HTML elements.

- Dependency Injection
  Angular comes with a built-in dependency injection system that makes components highly modular, reusable, and testable.

- Routing
  It provides a robust router for building SPAs, enabling navigation between different views or pages within the application.

- Reactive Programming Support
  With RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript), Angular supports reactive programming and enables handling asynchronous operations with ease.

# Getting Started

To begin with Angular, you need to install Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Then, follow these steps:

- Create a new Angular project: `ng new project-name`
- Run the development server: `ng serve`
